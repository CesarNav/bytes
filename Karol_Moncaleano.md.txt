Hello everyone! My name is Karol Moncaleano, I am 17 years old and live in Ibagu√©, Tolima.

Actually, I am studying Agroindustrial Engineering at the Universidad del Tolima and doing the Route 2 of the MisionTIC 2022. I like this learning course because is about a topic that catches my attention and that I will be able to apply in my life, my professional career and my future projects.

Also, in my free time I like to listen to music, play the guitar and watch series and movies.
